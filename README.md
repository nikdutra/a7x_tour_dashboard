# A7X Tour Data Viz â€“ From Setlist and Spotify to Tableau

This project scrapes setlist data from Setlist.fm, enriches it with track and album info, hooks into the Spotify API for embeds, and serves it all in a killer Tableau dashboard.
From raw tour chaos to rock-solid viz â€” all for the love of Avenged Sevenfold.

Built with:

* Python (Spotipy, Pandas)
* Tableau
* Pantab
* TSC (Tableau Server Client)

Bonus: Click a song and it plays on Spotify. Because data should scream too. ðŸŽ§ðŸ¦‡
